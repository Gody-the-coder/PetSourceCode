        <p class="green-text">For the premium-quality products from the Graviola Manufactory, only hand-sorted leaves from
             small-scale farms are used - grown without any chemical pesticides or fertilizers.

                <p>
                To ensure the highest quality, the leaves are hand sorted twice. First, freshly after harvest 
                band second, after drying and before packaging. Each kilo of the dried leaves requires around
                15 hours manual labor.

                The smaller the cut of the leaves is, the better poor quality may be covered up. For this reason
                 we always sell the leaves whole, in their natural state, gently dried, alongside the further
                  processed products.

    <h4 class="green-text">Organic certification</h4>
    <p>
    Organic certifications are complex and costly. They simply aren't wothwile for small-scale farmers 
    as the certification would cost as much as the farmer earns in a whole year. That's not fair,
    but unfortunately it is the reality.
    </p>
    <p class="green-text">
    Of course, the Graviola Manufactory premium quality products are grown without any artificial 
    pesticides and fertilizers. Not certified, but guaranteed!
    </p>
    <p>
    For this reason our partners from the Graviola Manufactory are locally present and are at the
    farmer's side to help.

    The high quality of our capsules can be recognised in their colouring. A reduced chlorophyll content 
    produces a brownish appearance of the leaves and powder which indicates low-grade quality, ingredients
    beeing stored for too long, and/or poor processing.
    </p>
    <h4 class="green-text">Certainly it could be cheaper instead of better</h4>
    <p class="green-text">
    However, our experience has taught us that high-grade quality products have a much better flavour,
    a much higher content of important micronutrients and thus are significantly more effective.
    </p>
    <p>
    Top-quality doesn't appear from nowhere. The manufacturing process is time-consuming and expensive,
    whereas cheap products are generally mass produced and processed without great care. - Powder is
    often mixed with cheaper materials of similar appearance. Leaves are dried outside without any
    protection, while invaluable ingredients leak out due to exposure to ultraviolet light and rain.
    Allegedly pure juice is diluted with water. - Of course, these are just some examples of how NOT
    to do it.  In the best case scenarios, those products just do not work and only harm a once-valuable
    plant, diminishing its reputation because users experience poor or even no results with those cheap
    products.
    </p>
    <p class="green-text">
    For these reasons we emphasize to our utmost our top-grade quality products, that live up to their 
    promises. This is what our customers can count on!
