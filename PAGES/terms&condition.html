   <p>
    As far as no other written agreement has been arranged, for all agreements concluded between consumers or

   </p>
   <p>
    (3) Consumer in this context is any natural person concluding a legal transaction which predominantly cannot

   <p>
    (4) Differing terms and conditions of the customer are explicitly diregarded.
  </p>
  <h4 class="green-text">
    §2 Conclusion of contract
  </h4>
  <p>
    (1) The following regulations about the conclusion of the contract apply to all orders placed with 
    the supplier.
  </p>
  <p>
    (2) The presentations of products on the websites of the supplier or other media are not meant to be legally binding contractual offer
     but non-binding requests to the customer to place an order. By placing an order of the desired products, the customer communicates a
     binding offer to the supplier of the conditions shown in the cart. 
  </p>
  <p>
    (4) On incoming orders the following rule applies: The customer renders a binding offer by successfully
     finishing the checkout process by clicking on the button „Place order“.
  </p>
  <p>
    (5) The acceptance of the offer occurs by an automatically generated email as confirmation of receipt.
    This email means the order has been accepted. Otherwise the acceptance of the order occurs with delivery
     of the goods within the stated time of delivery. 
  </p>
  <p>
    (6) In case of failure of the shop software (e.g. wrong price calculation) the supplier has the right 
    to withdraw the acceptance. In this case the customer shall receive an email from the supplier explaining 
    the reason for withdrawal.
  </p>
  <h4 class="green-text">
    §3 Prices, shipping costs, payments, due-date
  </h4>
  <p>
    (1) The stated prices are final and already include value added tax. Besides that, shipping costs
    calculated during checkout process apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    (2) The customer may only use one of the payment methods offered during checkout process.
     Other payment methods are not accepted
  </p>
  <p>
    (3) The customer agrees to fulfil payment obligations immediately after conclusion of contract.
     When choosing the payment method "cash on delivery" or "invoice", the due date goes into effect
     with receipt of the goods.
  </p>
  <p>
    (4) If the payment is not made within 14 days after due date and the supplier has to remind the customer about the payment,
     a reminder charge of 8 EUR applies.
  </p>
  <h4 class="green-text">§4 Delivery</h4>

  </p>
  <p>
        (2) The time limit of delivery begins one day after the payment has been cleared for prepayment methods, for all other payment methods one day after
        conclusion of contract. If the end of the time limit falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal German holiday, the time limit ends on the next working day.
  </p>
  <p>
    (3) The order is meant to be shipped when the goods are delivered to the shipping company. Additional transit times to the customer apply.
